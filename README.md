# React Calendar App

## Overview

This is a fully functional, responsive calendar application built with React. It allows users to view, add, edit, and delete events on a monthly calendar. The application uses React Context for state management, localStorage for data persistence, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Additionally, the application includes memoization for performance optimization.

- **Add, Edit, Delete Events:** Users can easily manage their events with the provided CRUD operations.
- **Event Search & Filter:** Allows users to search for events by title and filter them by category.
- **LocalStorage Integration:** Events are stored in localStorage, ensuring data persistence across sessions.
- **Optimized Rendering:** The use of `React.memo` in critical components minimizes unnecessary re-renders, improving performance.

## Components
